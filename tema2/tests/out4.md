            1.  Second level, Item 1
                
                    1.  Third level, Item 1
                    1.  Third level, Item 2
                
            1.  Second level, Item 2
        
    1.  First level, Item 2
        
            1.  Second level, Item 3
                
                    1.  Third level, Item 3
                        
                            1.  Fourth level, Item 1
                            1.  Fourth level, Item 2
                        
                    1.  Third level, Item 4
                
            1.  Second level, Item 4
